# ChatHeads

## About

Chatheads is a multitasking substrate / jailbreak / runtime  extension written in Objective - C, aimed at centralizing multiple messaging providers into a single unified interface.

The project is split up into two repositories. The primary interface which is loaded into the springboard and handles the UI. The [extensions repo](https://github.com/c1d3rdev/ChatHeads-Extensions) focuses on the injected processes, where they handle the receiving of new messages, relaying them via RocketBootstrap to the main UI process

These were build using [iOSOpenDev](https://github.com/kokoabim/iOSOpenDev) Xcode toolset, in addition to [theos](https://github.com/theos/theos)

I no longer actively maintain these tweaks, however, I will do my best to answer questions and provide direction to anyone interested in contributing, or just generally curious the software.
